# Roblox-Virus

Roblox-Virus is an application designed to demonstrate how Robloxâ€™s Hyperion anti-tamper/cheat system can be exploited to achieve privilege escalation without requiring administrator rights. This application avoids detection by most antivirus systems, 
allowing attackers to escalate privileges and potentially execute malicious actions.
